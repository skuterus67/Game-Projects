  storyText: 'In the morning I am taken to the main square of the town, where there
    are gallows ready for me. There are lots of guards there and my hands are tied,
    giving me no possibility of escape. I hopelessly climb the gallows and then they
    put the rope around my neck. The executioner opens the trap door beneath my feet
    and as I fruitlessly try to gasp for some air, I wonder, what things could I have
    done differently to avoid this fate...
