  storyText: "So I pause halfway through and go to the gate. I stick my head out and
    see on one side few more cells and a dead end of a hallway. The other side leads
    to the hallway that curves right by the wall that I'm trying to destroy.\r\n\r\nThe
    guard is nowhere to be seen, so he must be somewhere around my hole. It's not
    wise to just stroll out with him standing nearby. I should create a diversion
    to lure him to the other end of the hallway.\r\n\r\nI think I saw some movement
    in one of the cells on the other side of the hallway, is there someone?\r\n\r\n1.
    Grab attention of another inmate\r\n\r\n2. Do something loud to attract guard"
