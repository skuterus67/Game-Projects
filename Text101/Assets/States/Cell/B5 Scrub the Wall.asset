  storyText: "I start to scrub the grout between the bricks and after few minutes
    I've cleaned half of one brick. This will take a long time and I should watch

    it's safe to continue. But maybe the window would be much easier to be tempered
    with?\r\n\r\n1. Continue with the wall\r\n2. Try to open the window"
