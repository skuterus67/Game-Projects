  storyText: "It is possible to pass the bucket through the bars in the door, so I
    do it and then I throw the bucket to the far end of the corridor.\r\n\"What's
    going on out there?\" I hear from the side hallway and some quick steps can be
    heard. It's quite dark, but the guard has a torch, so it wouldn't take long for
    him to find the cause of all the commotion. I should be fast.\r\n\r\n1. Start
    quickly scrubbing the rest of the wall\r\n\r\n2. Ignore that and just try to bust
    through"
