  storyText: "I finally wake up, in the middle of the night. The moon is shining brightly
    thorugh the barred window above my head. Due to my injuries I can barely move
    and everything is spinning. While trying to get up, I vomit into the bucket that
    was by the bed. It's handle is easy to remove and quite sharp. I take it, maybe
    it can be useful. But standing straight is almost impossible to me due to the
    pain i feel in my chest.\r\n\r\nThere is still time. Maybe I can find some way
    to escape...\r\n\r\n1. Try to pick lock with a handle\r\n\r\n2. Look around the
    room for some way out\r\n\r\n3. Provoke guard once more and try to stab him with
    a handle"
