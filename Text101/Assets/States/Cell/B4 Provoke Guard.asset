  storyText: "\"Hey, dirtbag! How's it like to be the worst prison guard in the world?
    You can't even properly knock someone out!\" I shout out from my cell. Few second
    later, the guard comes to my cell, but instead of entering, he puts a wooden stool
    in front of it and sits.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not gonna fall for that again. You're supposed
    to die in the morning, not now. I'm just gonna sit here for the rest of the night
    and make sure that happens.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he does. There is no way of doing anything
    toward my escape, I can only count long hours before my execution...\r\n\r\n1.
    Wait until morning"
