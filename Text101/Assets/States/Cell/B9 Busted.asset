  storyText: "As soon as my head sticks out through the hole in the wall, I am being
    pulled out by a guard, who apparently has been waiting for me this entire time
    just beside the hole.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was starting to grow impatient. What were
    you doing so long? Nevermind, because now I'm going to put you in another cell
    and just to be sure, I'm gonna keep my eye on you for the rest of the night.\r\n\r\nAnd
    he does. There is no way of doing anything toward my escape, I can only count
    long hours before my execution...\r\n1. Wait until morning"
