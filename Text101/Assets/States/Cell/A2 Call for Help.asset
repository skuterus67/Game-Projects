  storyText: "I scream at the top of my lungs: \"Help! Release me!\" and after a while
    a guard approaches me with a mean look on his face.\r\n\"Shut up, prisoner!\"
    he yells and rattles the bars of my cell. \"There's no one here to help you!\"\r\nI
    can see the keys dangling by his side, but there's no way of reaching them through
    the door. But the guard seems to be short-tempered. Maybe if I'll make him enter,
    I'll be able to snatch them?\r\n\r\nWhat should I do next?\r\n1. Spit in the face
    of a guard\r\n2. Back away from the door and look around the cell"
