  storyText: "I look around the cell ad notice, that part of one wall has been scrubbed
    and bare bricks are showing. Perhaps I can use the handle to scrub off some more
    grout and destroy the wall? If, of course, this is a task to be made in one night.\r\nOn
    the other hand, the same thing can be done with the bars in the window. The window
    isn't so big, but I should fit without major problems. But it's easier to be seen
    getting out through the window than entering the wall...\r\n\r\nWhat should I
    do?\r\n1. Try to destroy the wall\r\n2. Try to open the window"
