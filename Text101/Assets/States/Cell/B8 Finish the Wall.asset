  storyText: "So I start scrubbing some more and taking out the wall, brick by brick.
    The guard hasn't shown himself for a while now, but that's okay. If he would see
    that pile of bricks in my cell, this night would end a lot faster, than it should.\r\n\r\nAnd
    finally the opening in the wall is big enough for me to crawl through it. Should
    I do it?\r\n\r\n1. Go through the hole\r\n\r\n2. Where is the guard?"
