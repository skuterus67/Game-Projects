  m_Name: B15 Hit the Guard
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: "I grab one of the loose bricks and as soon as the guard enters the cell,
    I charge at him and hit him in the head with it. He falls to his knees, so I hit
    again, and again, and again. The brick eventually breaks, but so does his head.
    I look at myself and see that I'm covered in blood. The dead body of the guard
    lies by my feet.\r\n\r\nI wait a moment to chill out and listen for anything.
    But nobody else comes, so I start to walk carefully towards the exit. For some
    reason, I'm able to get to the exit door uninterrupted, so the only thing left
    to do is to walk outside...\r\n\r\n1. Open the door"
