  storyText: "Hmm, there isn't much - a simple metal bed with a blanket, a bucket
    with a handle and barred window. Underneath one of the walls there is more dust
    than anywhere else. I think it would be good to have some kind of tool to help
    me escape.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do next?\r\n\r\n1. Investigate the wall\r\n2.
    Remove the handle from the bucket"
