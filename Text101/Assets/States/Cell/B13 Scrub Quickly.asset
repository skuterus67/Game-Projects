    my bucket. I manage to take out three more bricks, but then he looks inside my

    is furious. I'm done and if I do nothing, this will be my end. He reaches for
    the keys to open my cell and finish me. What can I do?\r\n\r\n1. When he enters,
    hit him with a brick\r\n\r\n2. The wall is weak enough, bust through!"
