    far behind me. But I don't know where the exit is, I'm just randomly choosing
    ways at the crossroads. Suddenly, the guard behind me starts to shout and a moment
    later my way is blocked by two more guards. I'm trapped and there is no way out
    of this situation...\r\n\r\n1. Surrender and return to the cell"
