  storyText: "I scream at the top of my lungs: \"Help! Release me!\" and after a while
    a guard approaches me with a mean look on his face.\n\"Shut up, prisoner!\" he
    yells and kicks the door of my cell. \"There's no one here to help you!\" \nI
    can hear the keys dangling by his side, but there's no way of reaching them through
    the door. But the guard seems to be short-tempered.\n\nWhat should I do next?\n1.
    Spit in the face of a guard\n2. Back away from the door and look aroung the cell"
